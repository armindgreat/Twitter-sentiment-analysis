# Twitter-sentiment-analysis

In this project, we performed sentiment analysis on Twitter data using various machine learning models and techniques. The models used for analysis are Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The analysis includes preprocessing steps such as tokenization and TF-IDF transformation to enhance the accuracy of the models. Additionally, we have done data visualization to gain insights from the data.
